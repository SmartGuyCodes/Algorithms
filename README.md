# Algorithms

The objecticve of this repository is to study a borad variety of important and useful algorithms - methods for solving problems that are 
suited for computer implementations. Algorithims go hand in hand with data structures - schemes for organizing 
a collection of information (data)

## Goal
	I    Classical algorithms implementations in a variety of programming languages
	II   Based on Object-Oriented and Functional Programming paradims
	III  Correct and ease of use, one file per algorithm

## Convention
	I    One file per algorithm
	II   Algorithm implementation for every language
	III  One demo per algorithm

## Topics

	I    Fundamentals
	II   Sorting
	III  Searching
	IV   Graphs
	V    Strings
	VI   Context
