# Algorithms

The objecticve of this repository is to study a borad variety of important and useful algorithms - methods for solving problems that are 
suited for computer implementations. Algorithims go hand in hand with data structures - schemes for organizing 
a collection of information (data)

## Goal

1. Classical algorithms implementations in a variety of programming languages
1. Based on Object-Oriented and Functional Programming paradims
1. Correct and ease of use, one file per algorithm

## Convention

1. One file per algorithm
1. Algorithm implementation for every language
1. One demo per algorithm

## Topics

1. Fundamentals
1. Sorting
1. Searching
1. Graphs
1. Strings
1. Context
